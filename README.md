Spring Async Request error on JBoss AS 7

This is example how to use Async Request processing and Spring Security.

See http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.2.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#servletapi-start-runnable

It doesn't work for me on JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final, it works on both Tomcat 7 and 8, and WildFly 10 though.
